1. **NPM Project Setup**

- Created a repo `cpnt201-a3` added `html file`
- Followed the steps for instalation over and over on examples until it was memorised
- Helped jibril with  setup, we ran into issue tryed over and over  and solved it. I was so proud of my self it helped me too
- After Played around with some css style until got familirise with it
- So decided to start working on actual assignment while setting up tailwindcss npm
- I ran into the same problem, i immedietly new what to do

2. **Tailwind Configuration**

- Full configfile available


3. **Content Styling**

- Recently i worked on Ghibli studio Api so i choose to work on it again
- Started from header to footer everything step by step
- After all this time i have learnend that:
   - First planning
   - Following all the steps
   - Going one step at time
- This way i dont get into problem easy and solve more then just going at it
- Well atleast I found this easy for me
- Took me forever to align image in center 
- Finaly found this :[stackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62347446/having-issues-trying-to-center-an-image-using-tailwinds-containers-invisible-p)
- Was having trouble aligning cards checked my code again and again found i was missing div hehe
- I was having problem with responsive card style so added break points it took me forever to fix becouse my `build` was broken again i was not able to see changes 
it happen to me few times.
- Dont know the reason?
- While i was adding brekpoint did somer style tweeking

4. **Basic**

What my understanding is tailwind is for our convience they have preset classes for everything we can just use those.
If i want to customise anything i can do that in tailwind.config
I think it is gonna be easy when i get more practice but while doing this assignment i found `tailwindcss` little hard.
Everything looks different and had to search for every single thing.

- Just published page and html is plan without css cant figure it out
- Had wrong path
